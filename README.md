# GeneLab_Training

## About
The [NASA GeneLab](https://genelab.nasa.gov/) Data Processing team and Educational Working Group members have created training modules designed to teach high school and undergraduate students how to process genetic and gene expression (aka “omics”) data using [GeneLab's standard pipelines](https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing). This repository contains space biology and bioinformatics lectures and hands-on instruction used during [GeneLab for High Schools (GL4HS)](https://www.nasa.gov/ames/genelab-for-high-schools) and [GeneLab for Colleges and Universities (GL4U)](GL4U) training programs. Each subdirectory in this repository holds training material for high school and undergraduate education levels for the omics data types hosted on the [GeneLab Data Repository](https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/projects).

## Training Programs
Click on training program below for more information:
- [GL4HS](GL4HS)  
- [GL4U](GL4U)

## Usage
We encourage students and educators interested in learning and/or teaching bioinformatics to utilize the resources contained in this repository. Although the enclosed modules are designed to analyze and interpret space-relevant omics data, the materials and pipelines presented can be applied to omics data in all life science fields.
