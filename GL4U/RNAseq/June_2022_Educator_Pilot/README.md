# GL4U: June 2022 RNAseq Educator Bootcamp - Pilot

This directory holds the bootcamp setup instructions and training materials used for the pilot GL4U: RNA sequencing (RNAseq) Educator Bootcamp, which was developed through a collaboration between [NASA GeneLab](https://genelab.nasa.gov/) and the [Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) Planetary Protection Center of Excellenceâ€™s (PPCoE)](https://planetaryprotection.jpl.nasa.gov/) Virtual Opportunities for BIoinformatiCs RESearch (VOICES) program, and utilizes the [NASA Center for Climate Simulation, NCCS](https://www.nccs.nasa.gov/) [Science Managed Could Environment, SMCE](https://www.nccs.nasa.gov/systems/SMCE) system for compute resources. The pilot GL4U: RNAseq Educator Bootcamp contains materials similar to the [2021 GL4U: RNAseq Student Bootcamp](../June_2021_Student_Pilot), including introductory command line and space biology-specific lectures, hands-on instruction via Jupyter Notebooks (JNs) for running general Unix and R commands and for processing RNAseq data using [GeneLab's RNAseq standard processing pipeline, version D](https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions/GL-DPPD-7101-D.md), but also contains instructions for educators to subsequently teach the bootcamp content at their home institution. These materials were organized into a week and a half long training program as detailed in the [schedule](Bootcamp_Schedule.md). The entire bootcamp will be recorded and the recordings will be uploaded [here](), broken up based on each day of instruction indicated in the [schedule](Bootcamp_Schedule.md).

## Bootcamp Setup Instructions
To run the GL4U: RNAseq Bootcamp at your home institution, instructors must request a time slot for resources on the NCCS SMCE system and accounts to be set up for all students who plan to participate. The instructions to request resources and accounts, as well as details about how to get started can be found in: 
- [NCCS_SMCE_Bootcamp_Setup](NCCS_SMCE_Bootcamp_Setup)

## Training Materials
Throughout the bootcamp, instruction transitions between lectures and hands-on training. In the links below, we provide 4 complete slide decks for each major topic covered, and those same slide decks split-up into sections based on when the material was taught during the week and a half long bootcamp. We also provide 4 JNs that contain the hands-on training corresponing to the lecture material, as well as completed versions of each JN. For information about when each section of the JNs were taught during the bootcamp see the [schedule](Bootcamp_Schedule.md).
