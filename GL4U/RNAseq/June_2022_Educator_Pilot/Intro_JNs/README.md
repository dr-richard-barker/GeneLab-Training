# Introduction to Unix and R Using Jupyter Notebooks (JNs)

The JNs in this directory contain instructions and commands for running basic Unix and R commands that are commonly used when processing RNA sequence data. To run these JNs successfully, the JNs and respective input files listed below must be in each bootcamp participant's /home directory on the cluster running the JupyterHub (or in the directory that is linked with the user's account when accessing the JupyterHub web interface, [https://domain/jupyter/]). The pilot GL4U: RNAseq educator bootcamp introductory JNs were run on the [NASA Center for Climate Simulation (NCCS)](https://www.nccs.nasa.gov/) [Science Managed Could Environment (SMCE)](https://www.nccs.nasa.gov/systems/SMCE) system. Completed introductory JNs in HTML format can be found in the [Example_Intro_JNs](Example_Intro_JNs) subdirectory.
> Note: Due to the large file size of the JNs, they may take a while to load when viewing through the web portal. To avoid issues loading the JN files, you can download the files to your local system by cloning [this repository](https://github.com/asaravia-butler/GeneLab_Training) using [these GitHub instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github/cloning-a-repository#cloning-a-repository).
