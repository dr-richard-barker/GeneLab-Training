> - HTML files created and called in the JN are not visible in the HTML rendering of the completed JN. Instead they can be found in the [HTML_output_files directory](HTML_output_files).
> - Due to the large file size of the completed JN in HTML format, it may take a while to load when viewing through the web portal.
