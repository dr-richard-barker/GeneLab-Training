# GL4U: Amplicon Sequencing (AmpSeq)

## About
This directory holds the training materials used for each AmpSeq bootcamp conducted. The [NASA GeneLab](https://www.nasa.gov/osdr-genelab-about/) Data Processing team updates the [AmpSeq standard processing pipeline](https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/master/Amplicon) annually in collaboration with the [OSDR Analysis Working Group (AWG)](https://www.nasa.gov/osdr-working-groups-awg-charter/) members, and subsequently updates the training materials used for the AmpSeq bootcamp to ensure the bootcamps utilize the current pipeline. Click on an AmpSeq bootcamp link below to access installation instructions and the training materials used during that bootcamp.
